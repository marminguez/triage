# TRIAGE

TRIAGE is an AI-powered system designed to help social and healthcare professionals
detect early vulnerability signals and prioritize cases before they become critical.

## 🧠 What does TRIAGE do?
- Analyzes non-diagnostic early signals (routines, incidents, isolation, adherence)
- Generates an explainable vulnerability score
- Prioritizes cases in a professional dashboard
- Includes an AI companion for follow-up and guidance

## 🧩 Project structure
- `/frontend` – Web interface (dashboard & case management)
- `/backend` – API & business logic
- `/ml_service` – AI models and prioritization logic

## 🚀 Status
This repository contains a functional prototype built for a hackathon / jury evaluation.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer
TRIAGE does not provide medical diagnosis. It is a decision-support tool.
